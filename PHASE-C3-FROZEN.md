# PHASE-C3-FROZEN

Phase C3 — Behavior & Validation — is hereby frozen.

No further modifications are permitted to Phase C3 artifacts
without an explicit phase re-opening declaration.

---

## Frozen Artifacts

The following documents collectively define Phase C3 behavior:

- PHASE-C3-CHARTER.md
- PHASE-C3-TRANSITIONS.md
- PHASE-C3-PROOFS.md
- PHASE-C3-FAILURES.md

---

## Freeze Assertions

By freezing Phase C3, the following assertions are made:

- All state transitions have explicit authorization rules
- All proof semantics are defined abstractly and unambiguously
- All failure paths result in deterministic outcomes
- Refund guarantees preserve RFC-XSTRP-0001 safety claims
- No XRPL assumptions exist beyond declared boundaries
- No behavior is implied outside documented rules

---

## Immutability Guarantee

- Phase C3 documents are immutable
- Later phases may only implement or extend behavior
- No later phase may redefine authorization, proof meaning,
  or failure handling defined here

---

## Effective Status

- Phase C1: FROZEN
- Phase C2: FROZEN
- Phase C3: FROZEN

Behavioral specification of XSTRP is now complete.

---

## Next Phase

Subsequent work must occur under a new phase charter
(e.g., Phase C4 — Implementation Binding).

No executable code is authorized until that phase is opened.
