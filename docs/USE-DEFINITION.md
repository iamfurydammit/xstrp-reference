# Definition of “Use”

For the purposes of the Payne Protocol License (PPL-0.1), a “use” of the
Software is defined as any successful, protocol-valid state transition
that advances a TransferIntent from one stable state to a subsequent
stable state.

Attempts, failed transitions, invalid inputs, rejected proofs, expired
intents, and error handling paths do not constitute use.

A use occurs only when the protocol accepts and applies a transition
that represents forward economic progress.
