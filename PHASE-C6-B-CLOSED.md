# Phase C6-B Closed — Wallet & UX Integration

## Status
CLOSED

## Summary

Phase C6-B was authorized to define governance rules and safety boundaries
for wallet and user interface interaction with XSTRP.

This phase produced:
- A formal charter defining scope, authority boundaries, and non-goals
- Non-normative wallet conformance criteria clarifying compatibility
  expectations without imposing implementation requirements

## Outcome

The objectives of Phase C6-B have been met.

No changes to the XSTRP core (Phases C1–C5) were required.
No implementation, integration, or deployment was authorized or performed.

## Closure Rationale

Wallet and UX interaction boundaries are now sufficiently governed to
prevent scope ambiguity, authority creep, or unsafe assumptions in future
work.

Further activity in this domain would require a new, explicitly chartered
phase.

## Immutability

Phase C6-B is closed and immutable.

Reopening or extending this phase is prohibited without formal
re-authorization.
