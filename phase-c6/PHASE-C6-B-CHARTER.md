# Phase C6-B Charter — Wallet & UX Integration

## Status
DRAFT — NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

[To be defined]

## Scope — What This Phase Does

Phase C6-B exists to define governance rules and safety boundaries for
how XSTRP intents are presented to, confirmed by, and handed off through
wallet and user interface surfaces, without altering protocol semantics
or assuming control over keys, signing, or transaction broadcast. This
phase ensures that human interaction with XSTRP preserves explicit
authorization, informed consent, and deterministic outcomes while
maintaining strict authority separation between the XSTRP core, wallets,
and external systems.
